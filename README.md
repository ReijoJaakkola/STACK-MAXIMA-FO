# STACK-MAXIMA-FO
Maxima code that I need for creating STACK exercises for a course concentrating on first-order logic.
Also random Python scripts for editing the maxima files, since at the moment of writing this code the maxima code that was inserted into STACK could not contain for example line breaks.

The code will be rather unstable since most of the functions will assume that the input that is given to them is correct (but I have added maxima code into the STACK exercises to validate the students input, but it did not make sense to also show that code here).
