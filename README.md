# STACK-MAXIMA-FO
Maxima code that I need for creating STACK exercises for a course concentrating on first-order logic.
Also random Python scripts for editing the maxima files, since at the moment of writing this code the maxima code that was inserted into STACK could not contain for example line breaks.

You can install a maxima plug-in for Notepadd++ from https://themaximalist.org/2017/04/08/maxima-syntax-highlighting-in-notepad/
to get syntax highlighting!
