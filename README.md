# STACK-MAXIMA-FO
Maxima code that I need for creating STACK exercises for a course concentrating on first-order logic.
Also random Python scripts, because I am lazy.

The code will be rather unstable because no checking is done for the input. Most of the functions
will assume that the input that is given to them is correct. However the code should be filled with comments to quarantee that those assumptions are made explicit.
